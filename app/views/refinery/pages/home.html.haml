      %h2 Is Atamai Village for You?
      %p
        Atamai Village is a special place where the sense of community, and our relationship with natural systems,
        is at least as important as the quality of the individual homes. It is not just another subdivision with a
        fancy name. We believe villages like Atamai will be the settlements of the future.   But everyone may not be
        ready for the transition to this new way of traditional living just yet.
        Are you ready?

      %p
        Deciding to be part of Atamai Village is a major decision and should only be made after careful
        consideration and, hopefully, a visit. To help determine whether Atamai Village might be a good
        fit for your family, we suggest you discuss the following issues with all family members.
